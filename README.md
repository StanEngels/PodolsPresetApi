## Changing environment variables 
Use the [LaunchSettings.json example](https://github.com/StanEngels/PodolsPresetApi/blob/main/Example%20files/launchSettings.example.json) and change the "change me" values to your values.\
Make sure the file path becomes "PresetApi/Properties/launchSettings.json" when you finished adding your values.

## Run the SLN file or use the "dotnet run" command
This should run the application and make api calls available from localhost.
